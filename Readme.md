## Introduction

CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language created for a simple, early home computer, the **Cosmac VIP**. It was designed to run on early microcomputers like the COSMAC VIP and the Telmac 1800. Many old games and programs were written in CHIP-8.

This project implements a CHIP-8 emulator that allows you to run old **CHIP-8** programs (games) on your modern machine.

## Features

- Emulation of the CHIP-8 virtual machine.
- Supports **graphics rendering**, **keyboard input**, and **sound**.
- Runs classic **CHIP-8 games**.
- Implements **basic CPU operations**: `LD`, `ADD`, `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, etc.
- User-friendly interface for loading and running CHIP-8 programs.

## Installation

### Requirements

Before running the emulator, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (if using a Python-based implementation)
- [C++ compiler](https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/) (if using a C++ implementation)
- **SDL2** (if you want to use the GUI features like rendering and sound)
  
For Windows, macOS, or Linux, SDL2 can be installed with package managers like `brew` on macOS, `apt` on Ubuntu, or `choco` on Windows.

#### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Chip8-Ver1.git
cd Chip8-Ver1
```

### Installing Dependencies

For a Python-based emulator, you may need to install some dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For a C++ implementation, make sure to install SDL2, and then compile the project with `make` (or any build tool you prefer).

## Usage

To run the CHIP-8 emulator:

### Run via Command Line

1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
2. Use the following command to start the emulator with a CHIP-8 game file (e.g., `game.ch8`):

```bash
python chip8_emulator.py game.ch8
```

For C++ implementations, you may need to compile and then run:

```bash
./chip8_emulator game.ch8
```

Replace `chip8_emulator` with the name of your executable if it's different.

### Controls

- **Arrow keys**: Move or interact (depends on the game).
- **Number keys**: Map to CHIP-8 keys (usually `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, etc.).
- **Esc**: Quit the emulator.
- **Enter**: Start the game or confirm selections.

For a detailed list of controls, refer to the documentation of the specific CHIP-8 games youâ€™re running.

## Running CHIP-8 Programs

To run a CHIP-8 program, you simply need to pass the **.ch8** file (or **.bin**) to the emulator:

1. **Obtain CHIP-8 programs**:
    - There are many free CHIP-8 programs available online. You can search for classic games like "PONG", "TETRIS", and more.
    - Ensure the game is in **.ch8** or **.bin** format.
    
2. **Load the program**:
    - Use the command `python chip8_emulator.py path_to_game.ch8` to load and run the game.
