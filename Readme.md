## Introduction

CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language created for a simple, early home computer, the **Cosmac VIP**. It was designed to run on early microcomputers like the COSMAC VIP and the Telmac 1800. Many old games and programs were written in CHIP-8.

This project implements a CHIP-8 emulator that allows you to run old **CHIP-8** programs (games) on your modern machine.

## Features

- Emulation of the CHIP-8 virtual machine.
- Supports **graphics rendering**, **keyboard input**, and **sound**.
- Runs classic **CHIP-8 games**.
- Implements **basic CPU operations**: `LD`, `ADD`, `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, etc.
- User-friendly interface for loading and running CHIP-8 programs.
